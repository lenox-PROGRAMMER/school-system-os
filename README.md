Frontend Documentation for College/University Management System
1. Overview
The frontend is developed using React.js for a responsive, modular, and interactive user experience. It functions as the primary interface for students, lecturers, administrators, parents, and hostel managers, streamlining access to all major system features.
2. Key Principles
    • User-Centric Design: Interfaces must be intuitive and accessible for each user role (student, lecturer, admin, parent).
    • Security: Frontend handles all authentication workflows (login, registration, password reset) securely, passing sensitive actions via HTTPS and never storing sensitive data in the browser.
    • Data Consistency: All data mutations (CRUD operations) on entities like students, courses, hostel rooms, attendance, and grades are managed through API calls to the backend.
    • Validation & Feedback: Forms must include real-time frontend validation, showing helpful feedback before API calls are made to avoid unnecessary server load and improve user experience.
3. Core UI Components & Pages
Page/Component
Functionality
Login & Registration
Secure login for all roles; registration for new users by admin
Dashboard (Role-based)
Personalized: students see academic and financial details; lecturers see class and assessment info; admins manage the whole system; parents view student summaries
Student Management
Add/edit/delete/search student records; view detailed profile
Course & Enrollment
Enroll in/drop courses (students); create/manage courses (lecturers/admin)
Attendance
View, mark, and track attendance for classes (lecturers); students see own attendance
Grade Management
Lecturers upload grades, students/parents view progress
Hostel Management
Eligible students view/book/confirm hostel rooms; admins assign rooms, handle requests, see status updates
Fee Management
Students view/pays fees; admin monitors payments; receipts generated
Notification Center
In-app, SMS, and email notifications; recent messages displayed on dashboards
Reporting & Analytics
Visual dashboards, downloadable and printable reports
Support & Feedback
Users submit tickets or requests; FAQ section
4. UI Design & Technology Stack
    • React.js: Core framework for component-based UI
    • Routing: React Router for navigation between pages
    • Styling: CSS3, Bootstrap 5, and Material UI for fast, modern, responsive layouts and controls
    • Forms:
        ◦ Real-time input validation before submission
        ◦ Error/success indicators and helper text
        ◦ Only submit to backend after passing frontend checks
    • State Management: React Context or Redux for managing login states, role-based access, and session storage
    • API Layer: Axios or fetch for RESTful interactions with the backend
    • Notifications: Toastr, modals, or snackbars for feedback
5. Accessibility & Responsiveness
    • Accessibility (a11y): Use semantic HTML, aria-labels, focus traps, and keyboard navigation for compliance
    • Responsive Design: All pages must adapt to tablet, desktop, and mobile viewport sizes using CSS Grid, Flexbox, or frameworks like Bootstrap
6. Example Workflow (Student Booking Hostel Room)
    1. Login: Student logs in via the secure login page.
    2. Eligibility Check: On dashboard, system checks if registration and fees are complete.
    3. Hostel Portal Access: If eligible, student sees available hostel options and current status.
    4. Room Selection: Student selects or requests a room from a list of available rooms.
    5. Confirmation: UI displays real-time status (booked/waitlisted).
    6. Notifications: Upon successful booking, student receives notification via dashboard and/or email/SMS.
7. Frontend Folder Structure (Suggested)

  components/
    Dashboard/
    Auth/
    Student/
    Lecturer/
    Admin/
    Hostel/
    Fee/
    Notifications/
    Reports/
  context/

  services/
  App.js
  index.js
  routes.js
  styles/
[Reflects memory: prefers methodical, structured workflow and separation of frontend/backend folders].
8. Frontend Development Workflow
    • Start with authentication and role-based dashboards.
    • Incrementally add feature modules (student management, hostel, fees, etc.).
    • Reuse components (forms, tables, navbars) across the system.
    • Use version control (e.g., Git) and document major UI/UX design decisions.


Backend Documentation: Express.js, PostgreSQL & Sequelize
1. Overview
The backend is built with Express.js as the web server/framework, PostgreSQL as the relational database, and Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for safe and efficient database interactions. The backend provides a RESTful API to serve data and accept commands from the frontend.
2. Key Technologies
    • Node.js & Express.js: For building modular, high-performance REST APIs.
    • PostgreSQL: Primary database engine for storing all system data in structured tables.
    • Sequelize: ORM solution for data modeling, querying, and relationship management between tables.
3. Project Structure
A recommended directory structure:
text

├── src/
│   ├── controllers/    # Business logic for routes
│   ├── database/
│   │   ├── config/     # DB config for different environments

├── .env                # Environment variables
├── .sequelizerc        # Sequelize config pathing
├── package.json
└── README.md
4. Setup & Installation
Prerequisites:
    • Node.js (16.x+), npm (6.x+), PostgreSQL (local or remote)
Steps:
    1. Clone the repo or create a new project
       text
       git clone <repo-url>
       cd <project>
       npm init -y
    2. Install dependencies
       text
       npm install express sequelize pg pg-hstore
       npm install --save-dev sequelize-cli nodemon
       npm install dotenv  # For environment variable support
    3. Configure Sequelize
        ◦ Initialize Sequelize:
          text
          npx sequelize-cli init
        ◦ Update config/config.json or database/config/config.js for your database credentials.
    4. Set Environment Variables
        ◦ .env example:
          text
          DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@localhost:5432/<DATABASENAME>
5. Defining Models & Data Schema
    • Models are defined in src/database/models/. Each model represents a table (e.g., Student, Course, HostelRoom).
    • Relationships (associations) are set up in model files—e.g., Student.hasMany(HostelRoom), Course.belongsToMany(Student, ...).
6. Data Migrations & Seeding
    • Migrations: Used to version and evolve the DB schema.
      text
      npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name create-students-table
      npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
    • Seeders: Populate DB with initial/sample data.
      text
      npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name demo-student
      npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
7. API & Routing
    • Routes are defined in src/routes/.
    • Typical REST endpoints:
        ◦ GET /students — List students
        ◦ POST /students — Register student
        ◦ GET /hostel/rooms — List hostel rooms
        ◦ POST /hostel/booking — Book/assign hostel room
    • Controllers in src/controllers/ handle business logic, and services abstract database transactions.
8. Error Handling & Input Validation
    • Use Express middleware for error catching and input validation (e.g., Joi for schema validation).
    • Ensure all API endpoints validate incoming requests before processing.
9. Security
    • Passwords are always hashed using bcrypt or similar before storing.
    • JWT-based authentication for all protected routes.
    • Never store sensitive information in plain text. Use parameterized queries via Sequelize to prevent SQL injection.
    • Only expose necessary API endpoints and apply role-based access checks in middleware.
10. Running the System
Development mode:
text
npm run dev
Server starts at http://localhost:3000 (configurable).
Production mode:
Set your environment variables and use node src/server.js or a process manager like PM2.
11. Example Sequelize Connection
js
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = new Sequelize(
  process.env.PGDATABASE,
  process.env.PGUSER,
  process.env.PGPASSWORD,
  {
    host: process.env.PGHOST,
    dialect: 'postgres',
    port: 5432,
    logging: false,
  }
);

sequelize.authenticate()
  .then(() => console.log('DB Connected'))
  .catch((err) => console.error('DB Connection Error:', err));
12. Maintenance Notes
    • Keep dependencies updated.
    • Automate regular DB backups.
    • Write automated tests for endpoints.
    • Document API endpoints using Swagger/OpenAPI (optional but recommended).
